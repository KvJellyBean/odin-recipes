        <p>Fried chicken is a beloved comfort food that's cherished for its crispy, golden-brown exterior and juicy,
            tender interior. This classic dish consists of bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces, often thighs and drumsticks,
            coated in a seasoned flour mixture and deep-fried until irresistibly crunchy. The seasoned flour blend adds
            a delightful mix of flavors, and the end result is a satisfying and flavorful treat that's perfect for any
            meal.</p>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <section>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a large, deep skillet or deep fryer, pour enough vegetable oil to submerge the chicken
                            pieces. Heat the oil to 350째F (175째C).</li>
                        <li>In a shallow dish or a plastic bag, combine the flour, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic
                            powder, onion powder, and dried thyme. Mix well.
                        </li>
                        <li>Dredge each chicken piece in the seasoned flour mixture, ensuring it's coated evenly. Shake
                            off any excess flour.</li>
                        <li>Carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil, one at a time. Be cautious to
                            avoid overcrowding the skillet, which can reduce the oil temperature and affect the
                            crispiness of the chicken.</li>
                        <li>Fry the chicken for about 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the pieces are golden
                            brown and the internal temperature reaches at least 165째F (74째C).</li>
                        <li>Remove the fried chicken from the oil and place it on a plate lined with paper towels to
                            drain excess oil.</li>
                        <li>Allow the fried chicken to rest for a few minutes before serving. This helps the chicken
                            stay juicy and retain its crispy coating.</li>
                        <li>Serve your simple fried chicken hot with your favorite side dishes, such as mashed potatoes,
                            coleslaw, or biscuits. Enjoy!</li>
