        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian pasta dish known for its layers of rich, savory flavors. It typically consists
            of wide flat pasta sheets layered with a delicious mixture of cheese, sauce, and often includes ground meat
            or vegetables. The entire dish is then baked until it's bubbling and golden, creating a comforting and
            satisfying meal.</p>

            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 15
                minutes.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine ricotta cheese, 1 cup of shredded mozzarella, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, one

            <li>Spread a portion of the cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of meat sauce. Repeat the
